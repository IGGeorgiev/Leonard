This directory contains "sketches" (Arduino's name for projects). Use the Arduino program (on DICE, Hit Alt+F2, type arduino, hit return) to view them, modify and program them to the Arduino. 

Note that some projects contain a lot of files and the Arduino program didn't think of including a scrollbar on the file selector so you may have to use an external editor to modify some of the files which are inaccessible through Arduino editor.

Avoid programming Arduino over RF, plug it in over USB instead.

The instructioncc sketch is what runs on the Arduino during a match. 
The test-sketches contains some more sketches useful for testing Arduino hardware and such.
