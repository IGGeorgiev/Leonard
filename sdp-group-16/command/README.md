This directory contains implementations of both high and low level strategy.

Each team has their own concrete commander class (e.g. Commander7 - commander_team7.py) which supports a number of high level tasks.
The abstract class (Commander) that should be implemented by both teams can be found in commander_interface.py.

The overall strategy i.e. what each commander should be doing is assigned by the Strategy_controller class in strategy_controller.py.

Each .py file contains basic documentation within.
